Writing
Personal essay
Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a
new understanding of yourself or others.
Blue… black… green….red…? I felt overwhelmed as the kaleidoscope of backpacks stared back at
me.
“Mijo, just pick a color,” my mamá’s voice cut through the hesitation.
I had an affinity for red; however, the local canals' blues and the banyan trees' greens near my new
home made red feel loud. Out of place. Despite all this, my mamá sensed my inclination toward
the red Jansport, took it off the hook, and assured me of the decision’s triviality.
But it wasn’t just a backpack. It became the centerpiece of my 10-year-old self. Red screamed for
attention in a sea of neutral blues and blacks, much like how the empanadas and arepas, which
my mamá lovingly packed for lunch, stood out from the PB&Js around me. Each curious glance
acted as a spotlight on how I didn’t belong. My cheeks flushed the same shade as my backpack.
Wrapped in red, I grew angry toward what once made me feel loved but now made me feel
ostracized. Almost as if she heard my cries, my mamá maternally remarked, “If you don't like
something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.”
So, I began to see red differently. It was the color of ripe strawberries my abuela would slice me
after school. Her benevolence never failed to warm our household. It was the hue of my mamá’s
handmade birthday cards with wobbly hearts. The kind that makes you chuckle at their perfect
imperfections. It was the shade of the umbrella my papá used to shield me from the fierce Florida
rain as we awkwardly jogged to the car. It was even the ink of the pen my teacher used to mark my
papers, sometimes harshly, but always with lessons I needed to learn. Red was relentlessly
demanding, yet I began to find it oddly encouraging.
This positive facet of red came to life when I traded my first stock. The market was a swirl of
colors: green for gains, red for losses. It would challenge my resolve as I spent weeks and months
with my performance charts plastered in red. But I internalized this fire, using it as motivation to
conquer the color that had followed me my entire life. I learned through trading that facing red
does not always mean failure; it is an opportunity to strategize and bounce back into green.
What the stock market taught me eclipsed finance. Whether I was garnering attention for my
YouTube channel or raising money for my fund alongside my friend Anthony, I began to
understand that success is built on the foundation of past failures. But I would be lying to say that
my battle with red was over. In fact, it was just beginning. “A first-time fund is destined to burn,
especially if it's run by two teenagers,” I was told over and over again, and it was demoralizing. Our
demise felt inevitable. I thought back to my mamá’s endearing words and realized my outlook was
all that mattered.
The flames of red devour, yes, but they also forge.
When everyone else shrinks from the blaze, I have learned to step closer. Late nights would blur

into early mornings until Anthony and I started to enjoy the fruits of our labor. We have raised
thousands in capital, but the journey isn’t over. The pressure never eases – convincing stern
financiers to back two inexperienced teens – nor do the doubts: those nagging questions of my
ability and fear of losing trust. But in these moments, red has become my greatest asset. From a
choice of backpack to managing my own fund and non-profit, that fiery crimson has taught me to
embrace the moments that test me the most.
Blue, black, green, or red?
I now know the answer is red, but it extends beyond aesthetic appeal. It’s a declaration of who I
am.

Additional information
Founding S&V Fund Management was an arduous process extending beyond our role as portfolio
managers – the legal filings were treacherous. Although my partner, Anthony Viverito, and I cofounded the fund, I will not be recognized as an official investment manager or co-owner in the
legal documents, given my status as a minor. However, Anthony/ S&V Fund Management and I
have a formal agreement in legal documentation that once I turn eighteen, I will assume my 50%
stake in the company, consistent with U.S Securities regulations that generally require investment
managers to have legal capacity.
After contacting numerous banks, legal agencies, and back-office teams and being rejected
repeatedly, we found Fundviews Capital LLC. This corporation is a fund management platform that
handles the entirety of back-office work so its clients can focus on their investment decisions.
Essentially, we manage a corporation that manages an investment series under Fundviews
Capital. The entire establishment of S&V Capital/S&V Fund Management spanned over two years,
consisting of extensive research on our investment strategy and negotiating with Fundviews to
establish proper contracts.

Short Questions
Most significant challenge society faces
Digital overstimulation. The human brain is the most powerful computer that exists, so why do we
so frequently relinquish its capacities by substituting boredom for Instagram and TikTok?
Sometimes, just sitting and thinking, while challenging, is the most profound thing we can do.

Last two summers

CA Sini, Tommaso CEEB: 101239 Fall 2025

15

FY RD CAID: 39066739

GHF: Spreadsheets and client acquisition optimization; I learned that “traditional” financial
advising can feel scammy.

Corpay: DCF modeling is not for the weak. I discovered the uncharted waters of quantitative
finance.
HHRC: I taught Hispanic immigrants everything from retaining a good credit score to investing in
the stock market.

Historical moment or event you'd like to witness
The Introduction of Futures Contracts in Ancient Babylon.
My hedge fund trades options on futures contracts, a concept established in the Code of
Hammurabi. The moment of human ingenuity that gave birth to a one-quadrillion-dollar financial
derivatives market would inspire me to be a force for innovation in modern finance.

Extracurricular activity, job, or family responsibility
Rio Tinto – fundamentally a solid company; however, accusations of violating child labor laws…
now what? My only objective upon spearheading my school’s $60,000 student fund was to
understand my investments better than anyone else. That’s when I realized that investing isn’t just
about performance but also moral responsibility.
Five things that are important to you
1. Nightly prayer strengthens my faith.
2. “HELP!” I scream to my spotter. The gym is my sanctuary for camaraderie.
3. Jean Paul Gaultier cologne: my aromatic authenticity.
4. I come home, grab an apple, yell, “APPLE,” and my dog comes running.
5. Ranting on Facetime retains sanity… and happiness.

Short Essays
Idea or experience that makes you excited about learning

CA Sini, Tommaso CEEB: 101239 Fall 2025

FY RD CAID: 39066739

Why would stocks involve bouncing cats? I was 12, and rather than begging my mom to go to
GameStop for the new Call of Duty, I became fascinated by the frenzy around GME’s stock price.
Yet, I was perplexed by terms like “dead cat bounce.” The idea that convoluted metaphors could
dictate market sentiment riveted my childish imagination and eagerness to learn more. However,
denied my right to learn by pricey paywalls and incomprehensible language, I turned to YouTube to
satisfy my hunger. Fed up by the countless comments stating, “more confused than before…” I
dedicated my freshman year to demystifying the financial jargon that deters many aspiring
financiers.
And just like that, WeeklyTheta was born.
I revel in the nuances of finance, and through daily articles, YouTube videos, tutoring sessions, and
presentations, WeeklyTheta presents these complexities in easily digestible formats. Educating
others bolstered my passion to another level. I now yearn to discover the multidimensional
influences of the economy – specifically, the impact of the economy on social systems, ensuring
that the markets become a tool for positive social change.
Investigating how Redwood City’s taquerias and boutiques navigate price fluctuations or how
they’re impacted by seemingly distant corporate decisions goes beyond lessons in a textbook. I’m
enthralled by the idea that markets aren’t just numbers but living ecosystems with real effects. If a
single “bouncing cat” can shake my curiosity, I imagine Stanford’s commitment to bringing realworld applications out of the classroom discussion will be a purr-fectly enlightening ride.

Note to future roommate
Hi Roommate!
My name is Tommaso, but people call me Tommy. My passion is in economics, but unless you are
interested, I promise not to bore you with rants about the market’s performance. Allow me to take
you through a day in my life so you know what to expect.
My time after classes always starts in the gym, where my brain and body go to battle. I hope you’ll
consider joining me there, spotting each other through tough sets and lending a hand when the
weight feels too heavy – figuratively and literally. In many ways, the gym mirrors life. There, the
chaotic ambiance is like navigating demanding classes and deadlines. Pressure transforms into
stress, rep by rep. Yet, in the extreme intensity, I discover solace.
These workouts justify the feast that follows. With you, I plan to tackle the Bay Area’s culinary
scene. Each bite is a new adventure: Dungeness crab at Fisherman’s Wharf, overstuffed burritos in
the Mission, steamy dim sum in Chinatown. Let’s wander through this food lover’s paradise,
sharing meals and laughter.
Apologies – as the rest of my body falls asleep, my deviated septum wakes up. My nights have
their own soundtrack (less lullaby and more nasal jazz). Don’t worry, though; Breathe Right strips
are clutch, and I have great ear plug recommendations if you need them. It’s not glamorous, but
it’s me. I hope you’ll find some charm in that, and I’m excited to find out what makes you, you.
Sincerely,

CA Sini, Tommaso CEEB: 101239 Fall 2025

Life experiences, interests and character that would help you make a distinctive contribution to
Stanford
Football Sundays are how stereotypical American families bond. Mine? Long dinners.
These dinners, a staple of my heritage, found new importance during my internship at the Hispanic
Human Resources Council. As I played with children and helped their parents with financial
concerns, bonds formed naturally. One family even invited me to their fiesta. I accepted the offer
out of gratitude, but what started as a meal transformed into heartfelt storytelling. Their abuela
yelled, “Mientras haya familia y tamales, la vida es una fiesta!” (As long as there is family and
tamales, life is a party). I realized it wasn’t just my family that bonded in this way – fiestas are the
Hispanic version of American football Sunday.
Through these gatherings, we learn about one another, forging profound bonds in life’s smallest
moments. Just as another family’s fiesta reshaped my view of my own heritage, I aspire to be a
vessel fostering multifaceted perspectives on culture at Stanford. I envision hosting “Sunday
Stories,” student-led sessions where peers share traditions. There, I hope to connect with fellow
first-generation students, learning how, despite being rooted in distinct cultures, we are shaped by
parallel challenges and can create shared experiences. At Stanford Stadium, I hope to cheer in a
new way by understanding the power of diverse perspectives coming together to form a unified
community – with everyone embodying the heart of a Tree. I intend to cherish every last moment
in Palo Alto like how I now cherish my dinners (a fiesta)!
